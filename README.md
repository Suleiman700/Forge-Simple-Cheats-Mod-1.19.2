### How Does Ore Finder Works:

When enabled, It will search for all blocks around you (10 blocks around you) and will send you a chat that contains blocks coordinates (only visible to you).

This mod will get ***disabled*** after finding blocks (to prevent crashing because of too many messages), and you'll have to enable it again from the mod gui next time you want to use it.

#### Supported Blocks:

* Ancient debris
* Diamond ore
* Deepslate diamond ore
* Iron ore
* Deepslate iron ore
* Emerald ore
* Deepslate emerald ore
